# Global Pricing of Antibiotics per DDD and sustainable access

About this Paper
This study evaluates the global pricing of antibiotics using the WHO AWaRe classification (Access, Watch, Reserve). The work is motivated by the 2024 UNGA High-level Meeting on AMR, which set a target that 70% of human antibiotic use should come from the Access group.
Key Points
Data: We used IQVIA MIDASÂ® 2019 global sales data (value and volume) to calculate average ex-manufacturer prices per defined daily dose (DDD) across AWaRe groups and countries.
Scenarios: We estimated potential pharmaceutical expenditure savings if countries:
Achieve the 70% Access target.
Align antibiotic use with the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML).
Treatment prices: We compared 7-day treatment costs for common oral and injectable antibiotics in each AWaRe group.
Affordability: For middle-income countries, we quantified the share of the population at risk of impoverishment if paying out-of-pocket, using national poverty lines and income distribution models.
